# Chess Bot ##

This project contains the implementation of a chess bot that can be used with
[Xboard](https://www.gnu.org/software/xboard/).  
The bot uses java classes to model the chess pieces and a minmax algorithm,
combined with a custom heuristics, for taking decisions.  

If you want to play with the bot, install [Xboard](https://www.gnu.org/software/xboard/), go in the project directory and run:
```
xboard -fcp "make run"
```
